## 🎮 Gameplay

You are the pilot of a tiny ASCII spaceship `<^>` floating in deep space.  
But danger lurks above — meteors `@` rain down endlessly. Your mission? **Dodge. Survive. Repeat.**

- Move left ⬅️ and right ➡️ with **A** and **D** keys.  
- Avoid meteors — a single hit means **Game Over**.  
- No second chances. Just pure reflex.  

**Will you master the chaos of the void?**

## 📦 Installation & Running

### Option 1 — Run in DOSBox (Recommended)
1. Download or clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syfr-512/space-dodge-8086.git
2. Open DOSBox.

3. Mount the folder:
mount c path\to\space-dodge-8086
c:

4. Run the game:
SDODGE

### Option 2 — Compile Yourself (Two Ways)

I have already included a pre-compiled COM file specifically for DOSBOX but if you wish to compile it yourself, there's two ways of doing this.

(a) Using Emu8086 (Windows only. This is the one I used.)

1. Open SDODGE.asm in emu8086.

2. Assemble → Compile → Save as .COM.

3. Run in DOSBox as above.

(b) Using MASM/TASM + DOSBox (cross-platform, no Emu8086 needed)

1. Install MASM or TASM (available online, or bundled with DOSBox packs).

2. In DOSBox, navigate to the game folder:
mount c path\to\space-dodge-8086
c:

3. Assemble the source:
masm SDODGE.ASM;
(or with TASM: tasm SDODGE.ASM)

4. Link to .COM:
link /T SDODGE.OBJ

5. Run it:
SDODGE

Note: There may be some code incompatibility when compiling with TASM/MASM so keep that in mind.

Game created by: syfr

Built with raw 8086 Assembly in emu8086.

Runs flawlessly in DOSBox.

## ⚡️ Fun Fact

This entire game is written in low-level assembly language.
No fancy engines. No frameworks. Just pure 8086 metal.
